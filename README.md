# DeepLearning-CreditCardFraud
Code repo for the Cambridge Computer Science Part II Individual Project

## SETUP
To download and run files in this project you will need [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) installed which you can install using [pip](https://www.google.com). Virtualenv will install pip and a few other things by default. Virtualenv allows you to create virtual environments for python development, in which you can install a range of dependencies and not have them conflict with global python installs or other projects'.

Once installed, follow these steps:

`Git Clone this repo`

`cd <this repo>`

`virtualenv <envName>`

`source envName/bin/activate`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then you are ready to go!
